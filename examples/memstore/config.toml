# By default, assume that nodes with the address below exist in the cluster.
# Newly joined nodes will send a RequestId request from the beginning of peer-candidates in order.
# However, nodes that do not have an address here can also be added to the cluster, and the nodes listed here do not necessarily have to be added.
# In addition, when the cluster bootstrap, it uses the first address of the peer-candidate.
